##DESCRIPTION: In this task, you are required to automate the generation of a professional report by reading data from a file, analyzing it, and exporting the findings into a well-formatted PDF document. This assignment is designed to simulate real-world data processing and reporting tasks commonly encountered in corporate and research environments.
**You will begin by reading data from a CSV file using the Python library Pandas. The CSV file will contain structured data such as employee records, sales figures, customer information, or similar tabular datasets. Your Python script must correctly locate and load this file into memory, handling potential issues like file paths and encoding errors.
**Once the data is loaded successfully then our next step is to data analysis in which we are expecting to perform basic analytics like calculating the total number of records, computing averages (e.g., average age, salary, or other numeric fields), and summarizing categorical data (e.g., listing unique departments, regions, or product categories). The summary statistics form the core insights that your final report will highlight.
**After analyzing the data, you will move on to creating a PDF report using libraries like ReportLab or FPDF(here i have used REPORTLAB) The report should include:
1. Tittle
2. Brief summary of the dataset
3. Key analytics results formatted neatly
4. A table showcasing raw or processed data
   
**Your PDF should be neatly structured, visually appealing, and easy to read. Proper use of fonts, spacing, headings, and table formatting will enhance the reportâ€™s professionalism. Bonus points if you can add page numbers, logos, or additional design elements to make the report resemble real-world business documentation.

#TOOLS USED
1. Pandas - to read CSV
2. reportlab.lib.pagesizes(letter) - to set the page size of the pdf
3. reportlab.pdfgen.canvas - to create and design the pdf

 #EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
 pandas(for data handling)
 reportlab(for pdf generation)
 
#QUICK SUMMARY OF THE STEPS USING IN THIS TASK CODE
1.Read sample_data.csv using pandas.
2.Analyze (count employees, calculate average age/salary, list departments).
3.Generate a PDF using reportlab
 
The main goal of this task is to strenthen skills in data handling, file management, data visualization and report automation which plays a crucial role in today's world like business intelligence and software development. Additionally you will gain experience working with real-world libraries like Pandas and ReportLab, which are widely used across the tech industry.
